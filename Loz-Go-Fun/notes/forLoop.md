## Code Example:   
```
for _, name := range names {
        message, err := Hello(name)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
	}
```   
This is a Go construct that iterates over elements in the names slice or array.         
The ``range`` keyword allows you to iterate over a collection, such as a slice, array, map, or channel.           
#### The for _, name := range names statement is actually declaring two variables in this context:    
the blank identifier ``_`` and ``name``.   
## Range    
The ``range`` form of the ``for`` loop iterates over a slice or map.   
### When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.      
In this context, `for _, name := range names` iterates over a slice called `names`, with each loop returning two values:
1. **Index**: The position of the element in the slice, which is ignored using `_`.
2. **Element**: A copy of the element itself, assigned to `name` for each loop iteration.
Here’s how it applies:
- **`for _, name := range names`**: 
  - For each iteration, Go gets the next item in `names`.
  - `_` discards the index because it’s not needed.
  - `name` is a copy of the current element from `names` and is used as an argument in the `Hello(name)` function.
- **Inside the loop**:
  - `message, err := Hello(name)` calls the `Hello` function, passing the current `name`.
  - If `Hello` returns an error (`err`), the function immediately exits, returning `nil` and `err`.
  - If there’s no error, the loop continues to the next `name` in the slice.
So, `for _, name := range names` is simply iterating over each name in `names` without needing the index, and `name` holds each element of `names` in turn.
